# CTF Notes & Writeups

This repository is a collection of notes and writeups made from completing some CTFs and challenge rooms on online CTF platforms such as [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com) and [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com).

The flags required in order to solve the challenges are not presented in the write-ups or at least not entirely.

The notes detail how to replicate the exploits, while presenting the relevant commands that were used throughout solving the machines as well as some explanations, hints, etc.
